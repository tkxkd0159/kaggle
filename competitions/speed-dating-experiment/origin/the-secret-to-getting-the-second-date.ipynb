What gets people a second date? Why isn't garlic breath a variable in this dataset?\n\n**We're about to find out.** (Hang in there, single people!)\n\n### About the data:\n* Data was gathered from 552 participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. \n* During the events, the attendees would have a four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. \n* At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: \n  * Attractiveness\n  * Sincerity\n  * Intelligence\n  * Fun\n  * Ambition\n  * Shared Interests.\n* The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: \n  * demographics\n  * dating habits\n  * self-perception across key attributes\n  * beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate\n  * lifestyle information\n\nSee the speed-dating-data-key.doc for data dictionary and question key.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nI.

To summarize:\n * Take your date out to the cliche dinner and a movie because both genders are likely to enjoy it\n * Dating is tougher for men (perhaps women can be more selective?)\n * More participants experienced unrequited love than those that found love -- so don't feel too bad\n * People get their heartbroken regardless of their personal traits like attractiveness, so if you strike out, it's not you that is the problem\n * Your impression of yourself is often wrong\n * There is no one trait that makes you likeable\n * Being likeable is important for securing that second date!\n"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"default_view":{},"name":"speed-dating-annaeshen.ipynb","provenance":[],"version":"0.3.2","views":{}},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
